The Anime Recommendation Web App using Content-Based Filtering is a personalized recommendation system designed to suggest anime series or movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. Content-Based Filtering is a technique that relies on the content features of the items being recommended to make suggestions. In the context of anime, this means analyzing the attributes of each anime (e.g., genre, theme, characters, plot) and matching them with the user's interests.
